In LiPaD database, appears under a variety of `maintopic` values:

SQL:

```
SELECT maintopic, COUNT(maintopic) FROM dilipadsite_basehansard
  WHERE
    (position('question' in LOWER(maintopic)) > 0)
  GROUP BY maintopic
  ORDER BY count DESC
```

Some that seem relevant, to me:

```
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD
QUESTIONS
Oral Questions
Oral Question Period
QUESTIONS.
ORAL QUESTIONS
```
